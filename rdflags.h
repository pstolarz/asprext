   1. Unknown flags are ignored.
   2. If a flag with an arg allowed, occurs more than once, the last occurrence
      (and its arg) is taken into account. Duplicated flags existence is
      indicated by 'has_dups' flag.
   3. The " and ' chars may be escaped inside arg enclosed by them, but the
      func doesn't replace them in 'pc_in' string. 'has_esc' flag is set to
      indicate this case.
